# project-epidemio
The main idea of the project is to develop an open source software to analyze data of an infectious disease, creating a network graph of how the disease spread through the cities

The network graph:
A weighted directed graph where all the vertices are cities and, if there is an edge going from city1 to city2 with weight w, the correlation between city1 and city2 with delay w is 
above a determined threshold.
